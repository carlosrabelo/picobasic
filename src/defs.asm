# defs.asm - Memory map and constants for PicoBasic MIPS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# MIPS architecture utilizes standard MARS/QtSPIM memory segments.
# Variables are stored as 32-bit words for native MIPS performance.

# --- Constants ---
# Constants are loaded directly via li/la instructions.
