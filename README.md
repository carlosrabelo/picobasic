# PicoBasic

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

MIPS PicoBasic interpreter written in assembly, running on SPIM and MARS simulators.

## Highlights

- PicoBasic dialect supporting LET, PRINT, IF/THEN, LIST, NEW, EXIT, REM, INPUT, RUN, END, and FREE
- Expression evaluator with recursive descent parsing (+, -, *, /, parentheses, unary minus)
- 26 variables (A-Z) stored as 32-bit integers
- 52 KB program area with tokenized line storage as a linked list
- FREE function reports available memory (as command or in expressions)
- I/O via SPIM/MARS standard syscalls (`mapped_io` mode for interactive input)

## Overview

PicoBasic began in 2014 as a passion project during my Computer Science degree. Originally written in MIPS assembly to run on the MARS simulator, I built it to demonstrate to my classmates that assembly language could be used to build practical, fully functional software—like a complete BASIC interpreter—rather than just toy academic exercises.

## Prerequisites

- **spim** — MIPS simulator; install with `sudo apt install spim`
- **mars** — MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (optional, download from [missouristate.edu/MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/))

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlosrabelo/picobasic.git
cd picobasic
make build
```

## Usage

### Build and run

```bash
make run                    # uses spim
make run EMULATOR=mars      # uses MARS
```

### Build only

```bash
make build
```

This concatenates all MIPS assembly modules into a single source file:

```bash
# Run MIPS assembly source on SPIM simulator
spim -mapped_io -file bin/picobasic.s

# Run MIPS assembly source on MARS simulator
java -jar MARS.jar bin/picobasic.s
```

### Example session

```

> 20 PRINT A
> 30 PRINT A*2+10
> RUN

20 PRINT A
30 PRINT A*2+10
> NEW
OK
```

## Project Layout

```
src/                # MIPS assembly sources
demos/              # BASIC demonstration programs and test suites
bin/                # Compiled source output (git-ignored)
Makefile            # Build orchestrator
scripts/            # Build helper scripts
```

## Development

```bash
make help       # Show available targets
make build      # Concatenate MIPS sources
make run        # Build and run in SPIM/MARS emulator
make clean      # Remove build artifacts
```
